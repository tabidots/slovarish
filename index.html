  <h1>Slovarish Has Moved</h1>
  <p>As of 7 July 2025, the previous version of Slovarish has been <strong>retired</strong>.
  It has been moved <a href="https://tabidots.github.io/slovarish-old/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>,
  so you should update your bookmarks. However, please note that the app was abandoned long ago
  (ClojureScript apps are just too difficult to maintain!)</p>

  <p>However, you are encouraged to check out Slovarish's latest evolution at
  <a href="http://slovarish.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slovarish.com</a>. The name is the same,
  though it is a fundamentally different app.</p>

  <p>Thank you for your interest in Slovarish!</p>
